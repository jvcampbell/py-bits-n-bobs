# py-bits-n-bobs
My journey learning Python (from a SQL/BI background).


Starting with the bootcamp course from Udemy's assignments, homework, and capstone project. I'll eventually do all my learning experiments of Tensor Flow, and maybe using Spark on Azure.

Python is gaining traction in the data engineering/science market. R is good at what it does, but it's limited to the data field. Python is good for the same things, but being a general purpose language it seems more like a swiss army knife language to me, and will give me a bigger return on my investment of time. (That and I'll probably get more opportunities using it.).


### Udemy Python Bootcamp course
1. tick-tack-toe.py - A simple 2 player tick-tack-toe game (procedural programming - I hadn't learning object oriented programming yet).
2. BlackJack.py - A simple black jack game using object oriented programming. There's the player vs the dealer (the computer).
